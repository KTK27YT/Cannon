## What is this folder?

The Aesthicts Folder is just visual cosmetics for the cannon, specially the part that is meant to look like an Aim tool from any FPS game or a real life gun.

Plus_Updated.FCStd is the main file that contains the plus symbol itself. The way the plus symbol is mounted is the Tall_pillar.FCStd file from the base folder.
