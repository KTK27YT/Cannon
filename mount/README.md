## What is this folder?

The Mount folder contains the mounts and additional pillars for the cannon.

* Batter_Mount.FCStd is the file that holds up the battery pack. This is optional as you can just attach the battery to the board itself. However, this file assumes that your battery pack contains the screw-holes for mounting your battery pack.

* Hexagon mounting.FCStd is an odd one. It is used to help attach the flywheel to the DC Brushless motor, however if your flywheel already attaches to the motor, then you can forgo this file.

* pillar_for_DC_Motor.FCStd is the file that helps hold up the Motor to the hole, to basically propel the ball forward.
(You will need to print these twice and then attach the motor in between them)
